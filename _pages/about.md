I'm a first-year Master's student at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), enrolled in 2024. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Weidong Zhao](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/10459.htm) at the School of Electronics and Information Engineering.

My interests lie in intelligent scheduling, edge computing, and the intersection of large language models with industrial applications.
